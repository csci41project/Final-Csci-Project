cd whatevyouwant                                               //Go to directory you want to do the project in

git config --global user.name "yourgithubname"
git config --global push.default simple                        //do this unless you want to read about git pushing configs
git remote add whatevyouwant https://github.com/csci41project/Final-Csci-Project     //Set the git location
git pull whatevyouwant master                                  //copy the directory to your directory, creating master
git branch --set-upstream-to whatevyouwant/master              //Set the git location

You're all set. When you change a file and want to upload it run:

git add filename
git commit -m "Message about what you changed/added"
git push

To download changed code just run:
git pull

Make sure you are always working on uptodate files. git status will tell you if changes have been made. Or you can just run git pull
You can make a branch if you have done a bunch of work but someone else changed the file before you updated it.

git checkout -b newbranchname                                    //create the branch in your directory
git push origin newbranchname                                    //add the branch to the project 

git checkout branchname                                          //will move you between branches if you want to go back to working on master etc
